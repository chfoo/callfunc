# Binary distributions

For hdll files, don't be alarmed at the outdated verions. They are compatible with this release of Callfunc. They are rebuilt and redistributed only when there are changes in the C code. As well, Callfunc will raise an error if the hdll is an incompatible version.

Don't forget the licenses for Callfunc and libffi when bundling the libraries.
